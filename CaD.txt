Abstract
Importance: Vitamin D and calcium supplements are recommended for prevention of fracture, but previous randomised trials have reported conflicting results, with uncertainty about the optimal doses and regimens for supplementation and overall effectiveness.
Objective: To assess the risks of fracture associated with differences in 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations in prospective studies and effects of supplementation on fracture in trials of vitamin D alone or in combination with calcium (CaD).
Data sources: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane library, and other clinical trials databases were searched from interception to January 1, 2019.
Study selection: Prospective studies involving at least 200 fracture cases, randomised trials enrolling at least 500 participants and reporting a minimum of 10 incident fractures were included. Included trials compared vitamin D or CaD with control.
Data extraction and synthesis: Two researchers independently extracted data and assessed possible bias. Rate ratios (RR) were estimated using fixed-effects meta-analysis
Main Outcome and Measure: The primary outcomes were any fracture and hip fracture.
Results: In a meta-analysis of 11 prospective studies (n=39,141), each 25 nmol/L higher concentration of blood 25(OH)D was associated with an adjusted RR of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.89-0.96) for any fracture (n=6278) and of 0.80 (0.75-0.86) for hip fracture (n=2367). A meta-analysis of 11 trials (n=34,243) of vitamin D supplementation alone (dose of 400-30,000 IU administered intermittently with a median increase in 25[OH]D of 21 nmol/L) did not reduce risk of any fracture (n=2843; RR=1.06, 95%CI 0.98-1.14) or hip fracture (n=740; 1.14, 0.98-1.32). In contrast, a meta-analysis of 6 trials (n=49282) of combined supplementation with vitamin D (daily dose of 400-800 IU with a median increase in 25[OH]D of 23 nmol/L) and calcium (1000-1200 mg/day) reduced risk of any fracture by 6% (n=5449; 0.94, 0.89-0.99) and hip fracture by 16% (n=730; 0.84, 0.72-0.97).
Conclusions and relevance: Neither intermittent nor daily dosing with standard doses of vitamin D alone reduced the risk of fracture, but daily supplementation with both vitamin D and calcium is a more promising strategy. Results of ongoing trials of higher daily doses vitamin D are needed to guide the use of such supplements for fracture prevention.
 
Key Points
Question What is the available evidence for vitamin D with or without calcium supplementation and fracture prevention?
Findings Meta-analysis of the observational studies demonstrated that a 25 nmol/L higher 25(OH)D was associated with a 7% lower risk of any fracture and 20% lower risk of hip fracture. Meta-analysis of randomised trials of vitamin D alone (11 trials, 34,243 participants, involving daily or intermittent dosing with vitamin D [400-30,000 IU], with a median increase in 25(OH)D concentrations of 21 nmol/L) had no significant effect on risk of any fracture or of hip fracture. However, the latter trials were constrained by substantial methodological problems. In contrast, daily supplementation with both vitamin D and calcium (6 trials, 49,282 participants with a median increase in 25[OH]D of 23 nmol/L) reduced the risk of hip fracture by one sixth.
Meaning Neither intermittent nor daily dosing with standard doses of vitamin D alone reduced the risk of fracture, but daily treatment with both vitamin D and calcium is a more promising strategy. Results of ongoing trials of higher daily doses vitamin D are needed to guide the use of such supplements for prevention of fracture.
 
Introduction
Osteoporosis is characterized by low bone mass and fragmentation of bone architecture, resulting in an increased risk of fracture.1,2 Approximately 1 in 2 women and 1 in 5 men aged 50 years or older will suffer from an osteoporotic fracture in their remaining lifetime.1-3 Hip fracture is the most serious type of osteoporotic fracture with an approximately 30% risk of death in the year following a hip fracture.4 The incidence of hip fracture increases exponentially with increasing age particularly in women aged ≥60 years and in men aged ≥70 years ( Supplementary Figure 1), highlighting the high absolute risks of hip fracture in extreme old age.5 
Vitamin D is essential for optimal musculoskeletal health by promotion of calcium absorption, and mineralisation of osteoid tissue formation in bone and maintenance of muscle function.6 Low vitamin D status causes secondary hyperparathyroidism, bone loss and muscle weakness.6-9 Observational studies have reported that lower blood concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) are associated with higher risks of falls and fractures.6,10 A Mendelian randomisation study reported no beneficial effects of vitamin D on fracture, but the latter study suffered from weak instrument bias and evaluation in populations with a low overall risk of fracture.11 
Combined supplementation with 800 IU/day vitamin D and 1200 mg/day calcium has been recommended for prevention of fractures in older adults living in institutions and in those with low vitamin D status.8,12,13 However, previous trials and meta-analyses of vitamin D alone, or in combination with calcium (CaD) for prevention of fracture in both community-dwelling or general population settings have reported conflicting results, with some reporting protective effects against fractures,14-16 while others demonstrating no benefit.17-19 However, most of the previous trials had only limited power to detect differences in risk of fracture predicted by the observational studies, largely because of a combination of small sample size, relatively low equivalent daily doses of vitamin D, intermittent dosing regimens (>1 month), and short duration of follow-up. In addition, interpretation of the results of previous meta-analyses of such trials are complicated by use of variable inclusion criteria, inappropriate statistical methods, inclusion of multiple small trials with very few fracture events, in addition to failure to report achieved differences in blood 25(OH)D concentrations.16,18,19
In order to summarise the available evidence and guide clinical practice and future research, we conducted parallel meta-analyses of: (i) prospective studies of risks of fracture associated with prolonged differences in blood concentrations of 25(OH)D; (ii) randomised trials of vitamin D alone versus placebo or no treatment for prevention of fracture; and (iii) randomised trials of CaD versus placebo or no treatment for prevention of fracture. In addition, we reviewed the design of the ongoing randomised trials assessing effects of higher doses of vitamin D alone or in combination with calcium for prevention of fracture. 
Methods
Meta-analysis of the prospective studies
We searched PubMed and Embase databases, using terms for vitamin D, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 25(OH)D, 25(OH) vitamin D, cholecalciferol and fracture, to identify published observational studies of 25(OH)D and risk of fracture in English language that were reported before 1st January 2019 (SupplementaryTable 1). We restricted studies to those including at least 200 fracture cases (to minimise random error) and using a prospective, nested case-control or case-cohort design, and reporting blood 25(OH)D concentrations and risk estimates with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) for fracture (see Supplementary Material for additional details). 
For each study, we transformed category-specific risk estimates into estimates of the rate ratios (RR) associated with a 25 nmol/L higher blood 25(OH)D concentration using a previously reported method.20 Subsequently, we pooled the results of individual studies using inverse-variance weighted fixed-effects meta-analysis.
Meta-analysis of the randomised trials
Trials were identified by literature searches of relevant English language reports published prior to 1st January 2019 through PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and clinical trials database (ClinicalTrial.gov), using search terms “vitamin D”, ”calcium”, “randomised trial” and “fracture”. Reference lists of studies included in previous systematic reviews were also reviewed to identify any additional trials (Supplementary Table 1). 
Randomised trials of vitamin D alone were eligible for inclusion if they: (i) compared the effects of vitamin D supplementation with a placebo or no treatment; and (ii) reported a minimum of 10 incident fractures and included at least 500 participants (to minimise random error and publication bias). Randomised trials of CaD were selected based on the following inclusion criteria: (i) compared both calcium and vitamin D supplements with a placebo or no treatment group; and (ii) reported a minimum of 10 incident fractures and included at least 500 participants. Each trial was assessed for bias using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias Tool (Supplementary Material).21
Any fracture was defined as a fracture that occurred at any site, but if a trial only reported cases with hip fracture, these were also counted as any fracture. The study-specific RR (95% CI) were estimated using Peto’s one-step method.22-24 Data from individual trials were pooled using inverse-variance-weighted fixed-effects meta-analysis. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I² statistic (I² >50% was considered significant heterogeneity). Contour enhanced funnel plots were constructed to assess publication bias.25 Pre-specified subgroup analyses included age, residential status, geographic region, open-label, daily supplementation, concurrent calcium supplementation, and mean treatment differences in blood 25(OH)D concentrations. R software (version 3.4.2) was used for statistical analyses and p-values (2-tailed) <0.05 were considered statistically significant.
Results
Meta-analysis of the prospective studies of 25(OH)D and risk of fracture 
We identified 618 published reports of observational studies of blood 25(OH)D concentrations and risk of fracture (Supplementary Figure 2). After the initial review of titles and abstracts, 59 studies were selected for detailed assessment, yielding 11 eligible  prospective studies.26-36 Of these 11 included prospective studies, 5 were nested case-control (or case-cohort) studies (3469 cases with any fracture and 1575 with hip fracture among a total of 8052 participants),30,32-35 and 6 were prospective studies (2809 with any fracture and 792 with hip fracture among a total of 31,089 participants).26-29,31,36 Selected characteristics of these 11 prospective studies are shown in Supplementary Table 2 and Table 1. The sample size of individual studies varied from 800 to 14,624, mean age was 68.6 (range 52.6-76.7) years. The weighted mean blood 25(OH)D concentration was 59.2 nmol/L and the mean concentration in individual studies varied from 53.5 to 62.8 nmol/L (with the exception of one UK study35 involving much younger adults which had a mean blood 25[OH]D concentration of 81 nmol/L).
Figure 1 shows that a 25 nmol/L higher blood 25(OH)D concentration was associated with 7% lower risk of any fracture (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89-0.96), and 20% lower risk of hip fracture (0.80, 0.75-0.86). However, there was significant heterogeneity between results of individual studies for both fracture outcomes (any fracture: Cochran Q=31.0, df=9, I2=71.0%, P<0.001; hip fracture: Cochran Q=10.0, df=4, I2=59.9%, P=0.04). Likewise, there was some evidence of asymmetry in the contour-enhanced funnel plots for both fracture outcomes (Supplementary Figure 3). The pre-specified subgroup analyses for a 25 nmol/L higher blood 25(OH)D concentration and risk of any or hip fracture are shown in Supplementary Figure 4. The results for any fracture were more extreme in prospective studies compared with nested case-control (or case-cohort) studies ([0.89, 95% CI: 0.85-0.93] vs [0.97, 0.92-1.03]; Pheterogeneity =0.01), and in older than in younger participants ([0.88, 0.83-0.93] vs [0.96, 0.92-1.00]; Pheterogeneity=0.01). For the hip fracture, no significant difference was observed between subgroups by study design, age, region, duration of follow-up or baseline 25(OH)D concentrations. 
Meta-analysis of trials of vitamin D alone for prevention of fracture
Among the 1262 published reports identified for initial assessment (Supplementary Figure 5), full texts were retrieved from 52 trials but 36 trials were excluded for reasons listed in Supplementary Table 3. Eleven trials of vitamin D,37-47 and 6 trials of CaD45,48-52 were included in the meta-analyses, and one factorial-design trial45 was included in meta-analyses. 
Of the 11 trials included in the meta-analysis of supplementation with vitamin D alone (Table 1), the sample size varied from 686 to 9440 participants, and mean age varied from 65.9 to 85.0 years. Among a total of 34243 participants, there were 2843 events with any fracture (8.3%) and 740 events with hip fracture (2.2%) during a mean duration of ~3 years (range: 9 months to 5 years). Among these 11 trials, 9 trials had a high risk of bias, one trial had an uncertain risk of bias and only one trial had low risk of bias (Supplementary Figure 6). Selected characteristics of the included trials of vitamin D and fracture are provided in Supplementary Table 4. Among the 11 trials, 3 used daily dosing with vitamin D,40,41,45  but dosing in other 8 trials varied from weekly (n=1),38 monthly (n=1),44 quarterly (n=2),37,39 every 4 months (n=2),42,46 or annually (n=2).43,47 Moreover, only 2 of the 11 trials assessed effects of equivalent daily doses of vitamin D greater than 2000 IU.38,44 All trials used placebo controls except for one trial that had an open-label design, and all assessed effects of either ergocalciferol or cholecalciferol (except for one trial that assessed the effects of daily supplementation with 5 ml of cod liver oil containing 400 IU cholecalciferol).40 Among the 34,243 participants, 60% were women, the mean age was 77.1 years and baseline blood 25(OH)D concentrations varied from 26.5 to 65.7 nmol/L. About 25% of participants had a prior history of fracture. Trials typically reported that compliance with supplementation of vitamin D varied between 80% and 99%.38,40-42,44,45  
Figure 2 shows that supplementation with vitamin D alone had no significant effect on risk for any fracture (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.98-1.14) or hip fracture (1.14, 0.98-1.32). There was no significant heterogeneity between trials for the effects of treatment on risk of any fracture (Cochran Q=14.5, df=10, I2=31.1%, P=0.15) or on hip fracture (Cochran Q=3.0, df=7, I2=0.0%, P=0.89). There was some asymmetry in the contour-enhanced funnel plots of vitamin D for hip fracture, consistent with publication bias (Supplementary Figure 7). Subgroup analyses did not demonstrate any significant differences by age, residential status, geographic region, open-label design, daily supplementation and duration for any fracture or hip fracture (Supplementary Figure 8). However, there was some heterogeneity in the effects of treatment on any fracture by treatment differences in 25(OH)D ≥20 verus <20 nmol/L (Pheterogeneity=0.02). Supplementary Figure 9 summarises the results of a meta-regression analysis relating risks of fracture by achieved treatment differences in 25(OH)D concentrations. Among the 11 trials, vitamin D supplementation increased blood 25(OH)D concentrations by a median of 20.9 nmol/L, and 8 of the 11 trials increased blood 25(OH)D concentrations by less than 25 nmol/L. Blood concentrations of 25(OH)D were only available for a small subset of participants in each trial, but the meta-regression of RR by achieved differences in blood 25(OH)D  suggested that each 1 nmol/L higher blood 25(OH)D concentration was associated with a RR of 1.00 (0.99-1.01) for any fracture and of 0.98 (0.96-1.00) for hip fracture. 
Meta-analysis of the trials of both vitamin D and calcium for prevention of fracture
Six trials compared the effects on risk of fracture of allocation with both vitamin D and calcium versus control (placebo or no treatment) (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 5). Among these 6 trials, 5 trials had a high risk of bias and 1 trial had a low risk of bias (Supplementary Figure 6). Two trials had an open-label design, and all trials used either 800 or 400 IU/d vitamin D, and 1200 or 800 mg/d calcium. Participants had a mean age of 66.2 years and a mean treatment duration of 5.9 years. Among a total of 49,282 participants, there were 5449 events (11.1%) with any fracture and 730 events (1.5%) with hip fracture. Figure 3 demonstrates that daily supplementation with both vitamin D and calcium (for about 6 years) reduced the risk of any fracture by 6% (95%CI 1-11%), and of hip fracture by 16% (3%-28%). There was no significant heterogeneity between the trials for the effects of CaD on risk of any fracture (Cochran Q=7.3, df=5, I2=31.4%, P=0.20) or on risk of hip fracture (Cochran Q=6.0, df=5, I2=16.5%, P=0.31). There was also some evidence of asymmetry in the contour-enhanced funnel plots of CaD for any fracture and for hip fracture (Supplementary Figure 10). Furthermore, Supplementary Figure 11 shows that the combined supplementation of CaD was associated with even more extreme beneficial effects on risk of any fracture in the trials of older participants (≥80 years) living in an institution than those aged <80 years living in community (Pheterogeneity=0.02), and in the trials that achieved greater treatment differences in blood 25(OH)D concentrations (Pheterogeneity=0.04). Marginally significant lower risks of hip fracture were also observed in trials of older participants living in institutions (Pheterogeneity=0.07) and in those achieving larger treatment differences in 25(OH)D concentrations (Pheterogeneity=0.08). Meta-regression analysis based on a random sample of participants indicated that each 1 nmol/L higher treatment difference in blood 25(OH)D concentration was associated with a RR (95% CI)of 0.99 (0.98-1.00) for any fracture, and 0.98 (0.97-0.99) for hip fracture (Supplementary Figure 12). Overall, the results of CaD trials were consistent with the reported risk reductions associated with differences in 25(OH)D concentrations predicted by the prospective studies (Supplementary Figure 13).
Discussion
The present meta-analysis of the observational studies of blood 25(OH)D and risk of fracture (11 studies; 39141 participants) demonstrated that higher blood 25(OH)D concentrations are associated with lower risks of both any fracture and hip fracture. A 25 nmol/L higher 25(OH)D is associated with a 7% lower risk of any fracture and 20% lower risk of hip fracture. In contrast, the present meta-analysis of trials of vitamin D alone (11 trials; 34243 participants) demonstrated no beneficial effect of supplementation with vitamin D on risk of fracture. However, interpretation of the results of these trials is constrained by their small sample size, short duration of follow-up, high risk of bias (chiefly due to incomplete ascertainment of outcomes), intermittent dosing regimens of vitamin D and failure to achieve adequate differences in vitamin D concentrations. Furthermore, given that two trials which assessed very high annual doses of vitamin D both appeared to increase the risk of fractures (and falls) among those allocated vitamin D,43,47 it is possible that  intermittent dosing regimens with high doses of vitamin D may induce some toxicity.
In contrast, a meta-analysis of the trials of daily supplementation with vitamin D and calcium (6 trials; 49282 participants) was associated with a marginally significant reduced risk of any fracture by 6% and hip fracture by 16% (albeit the 95% confidence intervals indicate some uncertainty for these estimates). As with the vitamin D alone trials, these trials also had a high risk of bias. The risk reductions achieved in the CaD trials were somewhat greater in trials with older participants living in institutions and in those that achieved greater differences in blood 25(OH)D concentrations between the allocated treatment groups. However, given these uncertainties, further large trials of combined treatment with vitamin D and calcium are needed before advocating vitamin D and calcium supplements or fortified foods with vitamin D and calcium for prevention of hip fracture.
Previous meta-analyses also reported that vitamin D supplementation alone did not reduce the risks of any fracture or hip fracture in community-dwelling older adults (14 trials, 13,106 participants),18 or in the general older population (24 trials, 39,485 participants).19 The present meta-analysis differs from previous meta-analyses by excluding small trials (n<500) and those with too few fracture events (n<10) to minimise risks of bias. The doses of vitamin D used in most of the previous trials were too low to achieve sufficient differences in blood 25(OH)D concentrations predicted by the observational studies to significantly reduce the risk of fracture. For example, 400 IU vitamin D daily typically increases 25(OH)D by only 7-10 nmol/L53 and doses of 2000 IU/daily are required to increase 25(OH)D by 50 nmol/L. A meta-analysis of 11 randomised trials (31,022 participants, 1111 cases with hip fracture and 3770 cases with non-vertebral fracture) which took account of adherence and use of non-study supplements, reported that daily supplementation with 800 IU or more of vitamin D reduced the risk of hip fracture by 30% and non-vertebral fracture by 14% in adults aged 65 years of older.15 The extent to which intermittent dosing of vitamin D increases blood 25(OH)D concentrations depends on the dose and dosing interval but given the half-life of 2~3 weeks for 25(OH)D,54 intermittent dosing involving intervals greater than one month between dose is likely to result in substantial fluctuations in blood 25(OH)D concentrations and may not achieve adequate differences in blood 25(OH)D concentrations for a sustained duration.43,55,56 Significant lower risks of falls and fracture have been reported in trials assessing effects of higher daily doses (1000 IU) of vitamin D administered in combination with calcium supplements,55 but not in trials using intermittent dosing regimens of vitamin D (greater than monthly intervals between doses), or those using extreme doses of vitamin D at even longer intervals between doses.43,56 One meta-analysis reported effect modification by daily doses of vitamin D for prevention of fracture and highlighted the need to assess effects of higher doses of vitamin D.14 In the 11 trials of vitamin D alone included in the present meta-analyses, 9 trials allocated individuals to vitamin D supplementation with an equivalent daily dose ≥800 IU/d, but 8 trials used intermittent doses (intramuscular or oral) administered monthly, quarterly or even annually, and none of the 11 trials assessed the effect of vitamin D administered in daily doses greater than 800 IU/day.
Previous meta-analyses of trials assessing effects of both vitamin D and calcium versus placebo have also reported inconsistent results,14,16,18 due to differences in inclusion criteria and use of inappropriate random-effects meta-analysis16,18 (which inappropriately assigns undue weight to the smaller trials). One meta-analysis was restricted to trials of free-living participants and excluded trials conducted among residents in nursing homes,18 and others assessing the effects in fewer trials (4 trials involving 54493 participants, 5764 any fracture and 486 hip fracture) reported a borderline significant reduction in risk of any fracture (hazard ratio 0.92, 95% CI 0.86-0.99) and hip fracture (0.84, 0.70-1.01).14 In contrast, the present meta-analysis of 6 trials of vitamin D combined with calcium versus with placebo (or no treatment), demonstrated that such treatment reduced the risk of hip fracture by 16% (95%CI: 3-28%). 
Seven ongoing large trials involving a total of 62,857 participants are expected to report effects of supplementation with higher daily doses of vitamin D for prevention of fracture (Table 2).57-63 The weighted mean daily dose (or equivalent daily dose) of vitamin D in the ongoing trials is 2094 IU and is considerably higher than those used in previous trials. Daily supplementation with 2000 IU vitamin D would be expected to achieve a 50 nmol/L higher blood 25(OH)D concentration,64,65 and based on the findings of the present meta-analysis of prospective studies, would be expected to yield a 9% reduction in risk of any fracture and 19% reduction in risk of hip fracture assuming about half the effect is reversible within the scheduled treatment duration of the trial. However, assuming an annual event rate (AER) of 2% for any fracture and of 0.5% for hip fracture, none of the individual trials are likely to have sufficient power to detect a significant reduction in risk of any fracture or hip fracture of this magnitude (Supplementary method and Supplementary Figure 14). Moreover, the mean age of participants in the ongoing trials is relatively young, which will reduce their statistical power to detect predicted effects of treatment due to the low estimated annual fracture rates. However, a meta-analysis of these ongoing trials, involving 62,287 participants (effective sample size of ~50,000 assuming a 20% non-compliance rate), would have only limited power to detect plausible effects if the AER was 1% or less, but should have 94% power to detect a 9% risk reduction in any fracture if the AER is 2% or greater. For hip fracture, an AER of 0.5% would have 96% power to detect a 19% risk reduction in hip fracture (but such high rates are typically only seen in populations of predominantly older women).
In summary, the available evidence from the completed trials provides no support for the effects of vitamin D alone for prevention of fracture, but most of these trials were constrained by methodological problems. The results of meta-analyses of ongoing trials assessing the effects of higher daily doses of vitamin D are needed before making recommendations on the use of vitamin D for prevention of fracture. While daily dietary supplementation with both calcium and vitamin D is a more promising strategy for prevention of fracture, concerns have been raised about safety for cardiovascular disease and higher risks of kidney stones associated with calcium supplements17,66 and, hence, further trials may also be needed to assess both the efficacy and safety of higher doses of vitamin D administered together with calcium in high-risk individuals for prevention of fracture.
